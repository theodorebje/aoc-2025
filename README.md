# Theodore Bjernhed's Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)!
This is my first time participating in Advent of Code, ever, so I might not
fully know how to setup everything correctly. Please be patient!

## Regarding Dependencies

I have pre-emptively decided that I am going to try to use as few dependencies
as possible. Whether I'll be successful in this goal or not is completely
unknown to me as of writing this. But I hope I am able to stay away from
dependencies!
