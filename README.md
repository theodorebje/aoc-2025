# Theodore Bjernhed's Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)!
This is my first time participating in Advent of Code, ever, so I might not
fully know how to setup everything correctly. Please be patient!

## Regarding Dependencies

I have pre-emptively decided that I am going to try to use as few dependencies
as possible. Whether I'll be successful in this goal or not is completely
unknown to me as of writing this. But I hope I am able to stay away from
dependencies!

## Solutions

- [Day 1](./day-1/README.md)
- [Day 2](./day-2/README.md)
- [Day 3](./day-3/README.md)
- [Day 4](./day-4/README.md)

### Times

These times do not include the time it takes to write the `README.md` files nor
the time it takes to write the commit messages, nor any potential breaks that I
take while coding. These are non-additive, e.g. the times for part 2 might be
shorter than for part 1.

| Day |    Total     |    Part 1    |  Part 2  |
| --- | ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
|   1 | 01:16:16[^1] | 01:06:01[^1] | 00:10:15 |
|   2 |     00:32:40 |     00:09:09 | 00:23:31 |
|   3 | 02:04:19[^2] | 01:00:00[^2] | 01:04:19 |

[^1]: Including time to write commit message.
[^2]: Forgot to turn on the stopwatch… This is a guess.

### Source Lines of Code

This is only for Rust code.

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
|   1 |    188 |    211 |
|   2 |     39 |     45 |
|   3 |     54 |    135 |
